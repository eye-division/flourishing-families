    <h2>Why Focus on Parenting?</h2>
    <p>Around half of clients in mental health services will have a child (Seeman &amp; Gopfert, 2004).</p>
    <p>These children are at increased risk of mental health difficulties themselves, partly for genetic reasons, but also because of environmental ones.</p>
    <p>Supporting parenting in those with mental health difficulties can both reduce the risk of children developing difficulties and improve the welfare of the parent (Berg-Nielsen, Vikan and Dahl, 2002).</p>
    <p>The Flourishing Families Clinic aims to provide support to parents seeking treatment for mild to moderate mental health difficulties by providing parenting support. With this support we aim to improve parental mental health and, ultimately, the well-being of the child.</p>
