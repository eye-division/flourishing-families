    <p>Eighteen months after qualification, she was awarded a 3-year NHS executive fellowship to develop her research into anxiety in childhood, with Professor Richard Harrington. This was followed by a 4-year MRC Clinician Scientist Fellowship to trial a new intervention for families of young anxious children.</p>
    <p>She joined the University of Sussex and Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust in 2011 with an NIHR Career Development Award to develop and test a preventative intervention aimed at families with an anxious parent.</p>
