	<h2>Prof Sam Cartwright-Hatton</h2>
  <p>Sam is co-director of the Flourishing Families Clinic. She is a Clinical Child Psychologist.</p>
  <p>She began her career with a D.Phil (PhD) in the Department of Psychiatry at Oxford, under the supervision of Adrian Wells. The subject of this thesis was a MetaCognitive model of Generalised Anxiety Disorder in Adults.</p>
  <p>During subsequent clinical psychology training in Manchester, She developed an interest in the far less well-researched area of anxiety in childhood. On qualifying, she joined the Manchester clinical course as academic tutor, while working part--time as a clinical psychologist in the Manchester Childrenâ€™s Trust. </p>
  <p>Eighteen months after qualification, she was awarded a 3-year NHS executive fellowship to develop her research into anxiety in childhood, with Professor Richard Harrington. This was followed by a 4-year MRC Clinician Scientist Fellowship to trial a new intervention for families of young anxious children. </p>
  <p>She joined the University of Sussex and Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust in 2011 with an NIHR Career Development Award to develop and test a preventative intervention aimed at families with an anxious parent. </p>
  <p>She was awarded the British Psychological Society Award May Davidson Award in 2009 for her research into anxiety of childhood.</p>
