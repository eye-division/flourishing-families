<div class="editable">
    <p>The Flourishing Families Clinic is a totally new innovation in the NHS. It is being piloted by Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust.</p>
    <p>We know that many parents who have mental health difficulties really worry about the impact of their symptoms on their children. The good news is that most children who have a parent with a mental health problem will be fine! But, for some children, the chance of developing symptoms of their own is increased.</p>
    <p>However, we know that if parents can carry on being a good parent (you don&rsquo;t have to be brilliant!) when they are feeling bad themselves, then this really helps their children. The problem is, it&rsquo;s hard to be the parent that you want to be, when you&rsquo;re struggling with your mental health.</p>
    <p>At present, the NHS does not give those receiving mental health treatment any support in their parenting role. But some research by our team shows that giving parents a bit of help and advice about managing their children can really help those children to grow up happy and confident.</p>
    <p>Ultimately at the Flourishing Families Clinic, we want to see all parents supported to be the best parent they can be.</p>
